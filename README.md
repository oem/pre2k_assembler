# pre2k asm stuff

This is some of the very old assembler code that I was able to salvage, mostly because I had hardcopies of the sourcecode.

This is all coded under DOS and mostly with TASM.

## Deconstruction

If you spot an error please say so, the prints where not in the best of states and I had to fill in a few lines.  
My assembler is slightly rusty these days, especially regarding those highly optimized graphic operations.
